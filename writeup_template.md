**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

In this pipeline I use a grayscale, canny edge detection, gaussian_blur, and region_of_interest. This block of code for the pipeline would be on the top.

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline


Currently I need some feedback on how to create the pipeline that is in place for video proccesing. 



### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

These is a major imporvement that I need to make is for the image proccesing, to be applied for video proccesing. I would like some feedback and help on how would I exactly make the video part (Note: I already have the image processing part)
